I am a frontend engineer of 4 years of experience. I am skilled of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JAVASCRIPT**.

I am a master graduated from SCS of **BUPT**. 

In part time, I like to listen rock music and play guitar, and I used to be the lead singer of a metalcore band for 4 years. But at the end of the day, I am really a **BLUESHEAD**, I love blues songs, classic rock and hard rock. I think the root of modern rock is the old 12 bar blues \m/
