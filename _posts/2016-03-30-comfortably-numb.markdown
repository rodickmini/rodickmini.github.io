Hello.
打扰了.
Is there anybody in there?
请问这里还有人在吗?
Just nod if you can hear me.
如果听到我说话就点下头好吗
Is there anyone home?
请问有人在家吗
Come on, now.
出来吧 现在
I hear you're feeling down.
我感觉到你心情很失落
Well I can ease your pain,
或许我可以减轻你的疼痛
Get you on your feet again.
小心站起来
Relax.
别紧张
I need some information first.
首先我需要了解下你的症状
Just the basic facts:
只需要基本情况
Can you show me where it hurts?
你能告诉我哪里不舒服吗
There is no pain, you are receding.
疼痛还是没有一点都没减轻
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
一艘轮船在远处的地平线上吐着缥缈的烟
You are only coming through in waves.
而你像是在风浪里独自漂泊
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
我能看见你的嘴唇在动却听不见声音
When I was a child I had a fever.
我小时候曾有过一次发烧
My hands felt just like two balloons.
我的双手肿得像两只汽球
Now I got that feeling once again.
现在我又一次有了那种感觉
I can't explain, you would not understand.
可是我无法解释，你也不会明白
This is not how I am.
不要再问我感觉如何
I have become comfortably numb.
我已经沉入那种惬意的麻木之中了
Ok.
好吧
Just a little pinprick.
就轻轻打一针吧
There'll be no more --Aaaaaahhhhh!
不会再继续了——啊
But you may feel a little sick.
但你也许会觉得有一些恶心
Can you stand up?
你能站起来了吗？
I do believe it's working. Good.
我确信这效果不错，好的
That'll keep you going for the show.
那会使你的演出得以继续进行
Come on it's time to go.
来吧该走了
There is no pain, you are receding.
疼痛还是没有一点都没减轻
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
一艘轮船在远处的地平线上吐着缥缈的烟
You are only coming through in waves.
而你像是在风浪里独自漂泊
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
我能看见你的嘴唇在动却听不见声音
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
小时候我曾想抓住那个瞬间飞逝的场景
Out of the corner of my eye.
它在我眼角里闪现
I turned to look but it was gone.
我急忙转过头去看但是它已经消失了
I cannot put my finger on it now.
现在我不能确切的感觉到它了
The child is grown, the dream is gone.
那个孩子长大了，梦也已经消逝了
I have become comfortably numb.
我已经沉醉在那种舒服的麻木中了
