I've read a post online about improving spoken English. Today I'm going to summarize it.

## Implicit vs Explicit Knowledge

First, the author introduced how to learn English Speaking. He said that you cannot impove your speaking by studying the English grammar. Because speaking is an implicit knowledge, while grammar is an explicit knowledge. 

Implicit Knowledge is knowledge you can use automatically, without conscious attention, and it's fast, automatic, and effortless. On comparison, explicit knowledge is slow, non-automatic, and effortful. This type of knowledge is useless in spoken English.

If you want to speak good English, you must gain your time on implicit knowledge while reduce time on activities that result in explicit knowledge.



## Three ways to improve your English speaking skills

### Method 1: Listen to English conversations

### Method 2: Practice speaking English

### Method 3: Read in English



## How to add these activities to your daily routine

### Suggestion 1: Listen to English during "mindless" activities

### Suggestion 2: Practice speaking in the morning

### Suggestion 3: Read before bed (and/or during mindless activities)



## How to speak English fluently

### 1. Increase the duration of your speaking pactice

### 2. Expose yourself to a wide range of vocabulary

### 3. Vary (change) your speaking practice

### 4. Give yourself a project to do in English

### 5. Improve your English pronunciation

### 6. Be willing to pay the price
