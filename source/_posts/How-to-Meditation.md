> I listend a podcast about *How to Thrive at Work* this morning, it mentioned that meditation is a good way to adjust your moods at work. I'm trying to conclude the methods and every detail about it.

Nowadays, many people are suffering stress and anxiety from work. Someone want to self-medicate with food or gambling or TikTok. But that doesn't really work. One of the great ways to think about this is to feel the difficult feelings instead of letting them own you. And mindfulness meditation is a great way.

There are only three steps for beginning mindfulness meditation.

The **FIRST STEP** is to sit comfortably and close your eyes. For example, you can just sit on a chair. You don't have to get into the lotus position.

The **SECOND STEP** is to bring your full attention to something neutral, often it's your breath coming in and going out. Some people don't like the breath, so you can just pick the feeling of your body sitting in the chair or sounds in the environment.

And the **THIRD STEP** is the most important. As you find that you are very hard to concentrate, or focus on the breath, you are likely to get distracted a lot. And this is the moment when many people tell themselves a story that they are failed meditators. But actually, this situation could be a sense of success.

The whole point of meditation is not to feel some specific way, to stop thinking or to clear your mind. **The point is to become familiar with how wild your brain is so that the chaos in your mind doesn't own you as much.**

It's such a ==radical notion== that we can have a different relationship to our thoughts and emotions. And meditation is a great way to learn how to get comfortable with our inner ==meteorology==, our inner storms, so that they don't own us as much.

So, just observe the storms come and go, like a guard sitting besides a door, watching the cars drive in and out.
