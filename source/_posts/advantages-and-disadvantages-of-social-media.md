In today's world, social media has become an <mark>indispensable</mark> part of our lives. It helps us stay connected with our family and friends, share our thoughts, experiences and opinions, and keep us with the latest news and current events. However, there are also some downsides <mark>to</mark> social media. In this essay, I will argue that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

One of the greatest benefits of social media is that it offers us a sense of community. We can join groups or communities of like-minded people, share our interests and passions with them, and engage in conversations and discussions. This can help us feel less isolated and more connected to others, particularly during times of social distancing and <mark>quarantine</mark>.

Another advantage of social media is that it provides us with a wealth of information. We can access news, articles, research, and opinion pieces from around the world, all at our fingertips. This allows us to stay informed and educated on a wide range of topics, from politics and economics to science and technology.

Additionally, social media has become a powerful tool for <mark>activism</mark> and social change. It provides a platform for individuals to raise awareness about important issues, <mark>advocate</mark> for causes, and <mark>mobilize</mark> support. This has resulted in many positive social movements, such as the #MeToo movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.

Of course, there are alse some negative aspects of social media. It can be addictive and time-consuming, leading to <mark>procrastination</mark> and distraction. It can <mark>foster</mark> a culture of <mark>envy</mark> and comparison, as we see others' highlight <mark>reels</mark> on social media and feel <mark>inadequate</mark> in comparison. It can also lead to misinformation and spread fake news.

However, I believe that the advantages of social media outweigh the disadvantages. It can help us stay connected, informed, and <mark>engaged</mark> with the world around us. As long as we use it responsibly and <mark>critically</mark>, social media can be a powerful tool for positive change and personal growth.

    const ul = document.createElement('ul');

    const uniqueTexts = new Set();

    markedEl.forEach(el => {
      const text = el.textContent;

      if (!uniqueTexts.has(text)) {
        uniqueTexts.add(text);
        
        const li = document.createElement('li');
        li.textContent = text;
        
        ul.appendChild(li);
      }
